# Tradegolem

This is a work in progress, and is to serve as an extra feature to the predict-o-mactic project. <br>
The goal is to create a tradebot application in which each tradebot can be generated using custom parameters and strategies. <br>
Each tradebot should run in it's own docker container, and should be created, started, stopped and deleted programaticaly.
